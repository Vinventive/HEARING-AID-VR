### Portable standalone build for Windows and Nvidia GPUs is available in the releases.
### I'm looking for volunteers/contributors with different PC configurations who can help me to test out the overlay so we can make it accessible to as many good souls as we can.
### The current build has been tested on Windows 10 Pro x64, Python 3.12.7 (64-bit), and CUDA 12.4.1 with an AMD R9 3950 CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.
